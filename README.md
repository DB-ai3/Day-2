Today was my second day in the robotics session, and it turned out to be a really exciting and enriching experience. I got to explore and learn about a wide range of components that are commonly used to build real-world robotics projects.We started by getting introduced to the Arduino IDE, which is used to write and upload code to microcontrollers like the Arduino Uno and ESP32. It was fascinating to see how just a few lines of code could control hardware components like sensors, LEDs, and motors.

One of the most interesting parts of today’s session was learning about different sensors and how they are used in practical applications. For example:
<br>
1.The IR (Infrared) sensor is used to detect objects or motion and is commonly used in line-following robots.
<br>
2.The Ultrasonic sensor can measure distance using sound waves, which is perfect for obstacle detection.
<br>
3.The Color sensor can detect the color of objects and is especially useful in agriculture — for example, identifying raw versus ripe fruits based on color.
<br>

We also got a chance to learn about different actuators, which are devices that produce movement. One example was pneumatic actuators, which are used in heavy machines like excavators to control mechanical arms or parts by using air pressure. We discussed how actuators are controlled through signals from sensors and the microcontroller.Though I only have a basic understanding of programming, I really enjoyed learning how to write simple code in Arduino IDE. It was a bit challenging at first, but I did my best to understand how different lines of code control the components.One of the best parts of today’s session was being introduced to Tinkercad, a virtual platform where we can simulate circuits and write Arduino code without needing real components. This was super helpful, especially for practicing at home.During the session, I learned how to connect an LED to the Arduino and use a resistor to protect it from too much current. Afterward, I explored more on my own in Tinkercad. I created a simulation where an LED slowly brightens and dims using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). It was really fun to see it work and to understand how PWM controls brightness by turning the LED on and off very quickly.<br>
Overall, today’s session gave me a great introduction to how sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers all work together in a robotics system. I’m excited to keep learning more and try out even more advanced projects in the coming days.
